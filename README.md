Charter Communications Challenge

Please pull the project and run npm run start to inspect.

This project is rudimentary implementation of the requirements. If I'd choose to continue the development I'd improve the following:

1. Update naming convention of CSS to kebab case and use BEM to architect styling.
2. Use Redux in case our application might grow.
3. Paginate the records on the middle-tier/serverside.
4. Use tree-like structure to hold a reference to the records passed to the grid.

Please reach out to me via an email if you have any questions.
